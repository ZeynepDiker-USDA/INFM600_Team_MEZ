# INFM600_Team_MEZ
Repository for INFM600 Team MEZ

We are three graduate students from the University of Maryland (UMD), and our group is called Team MEZ. 
As of Fall 2017, we are taking INFM600 (Information Environments) at UMD. 
One of the learning objectives of this course is to demonstrate basic skills with GitHub.
To demonstrate our GitHub skills, we have been using GitHub collaboratively. 
In this repository you will find the individual assignments which were done by the contributors of Team MEZ, the data set we used for our group project, draft and final versions of the group assignments, and our license.
One of our team assignments was to create a GitHub repository, and upload every individual and team assignments into to this repository.
For our group assignment, we selected a data set about obesity. 
We uploaded the data in xlsx and csv formats of the data set we used. 
We wrangled our data with R application. 
Our data cleaning / editing process can be found in our repository, and if you want to replicate our steps, we suggest that you follow our scripts by using the “R_Script_Final” document, as we did many changes along the way.
